# PIPADMM
# Partition-Insensitive Parallel  ADMM Algorithm  for High-dimensional  Linear Models.
# The R package "PIPADMM" is available for implementing the partition-insensitive parallel  ADMM Algorithm, and can be found in the file "PIPADMM_1.0.0.tar.gz". The R package includes various functions derived in the paper, which are used for finding the closed-form solution of the proximal operator. Additionally, it provides functions for solving the maximum eigenvalue using the power method. The R package also includes several examples from the paper for demonstration purposes.
